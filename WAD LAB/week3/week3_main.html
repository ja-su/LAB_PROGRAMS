	Java is a high level, object-oriented, platform independent language.
	Java, unlike some languages before it allows for the use of words and commands instead of just symbols and numbers. 
	Java also allows for the creation of advanced data types called objects which represent real world things like a chair or a computer 
	where you can set the attributes of these objects and things they do.
	Java is very flexible - it can be used to develop software as well as applets (small programs that run on webpages). 
	But the flexibility doesn't end there because you can run the same Java programs on various operating systems without 
	having to rewrite the code (unlike some other languages such as C and C++) thanks to the Java run-time environment which interprets Java code and tells the 
	operating system what to do.
